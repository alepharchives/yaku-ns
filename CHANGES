Sep 09 2002		Now stuff that should never be < 0 are unsigned.
Sep 09 2002		Major change, merged with the new hashtable library
			version.
Sep 08 2002		Implemented wildcard Resource Records, see Docs.
Sep 06 2002		Fixed a problem in name_decode(). If the name format
			was bad, but the pointer-to-pointer where to
			store the name was set to NULL (used to only know
			the length of the encoded name by get_min_ttl())
			the function deferenced a NULL pointer, writing
			0 on it. Not exploitable to break in but a bad DoS.
